README forcrud mongo
Overview
This project is a simple hero management system built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. The system allows users to perform CRUD operations on heroes, leveraging MongoDB as the database through the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

Features
Hero Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete heroes.
MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB for storing hero data, providing a flexible and scalable database solution.
Modular Structure: Follows NestJS modular architecture, separating concerns into modules for better organization and maintainability.
